    <string name="about">
        Hanover College History is a mobile application focused on engaging
        Hanover College students, alumni, and supporters with the history of Hanover College and its
        campus. There are two main ways to interact with the application:\n\n1. Roam Campus - This
        option is a map where the current location of the user is tracked. While on the Hanover College campus,
        the user can walk and view each marked building. By clicking on a blue marker, the user can view
        the name of the site. By clicking on the name, a new window pops up with the information and
        photograph (if available).\n\n2. Browse List - This option allows the user to search
        through all of the sites and people included in Hanover College History. A user is able to search
        either sites or people by an alphabetical listing or category.
