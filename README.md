### Application Description
The Hanover College History (HCH) application is an Android application that allows users to engage and absorb the history of Hanover College. The application’s main function is taking users on an interactive historical tour of the college. The device’s location triggers content about a site’s history including a short informational paragraph, old photographs, and interesting facts. There are two options for campus tours: “Roam Campus” where the user can freely walk around campus and visually see on a map all of the sites in the system; “Browse List” where the user can select from various lists and categories of historical sites and related people they wish to explore. 

### Installation
Load the project in Android Studio. Enable the Development options on the desired Android device and allow USB debugging. Plug the Android device into the computer and install the application on the device. 
Note: If any changes are made manually (changes to current code rather than running a new query) to the database, uninstall the application from the Android device and run a clean install.
